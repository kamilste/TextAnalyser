package objects //create package to allow importing required objects

/**
  * This is scala object to allow analyse given input.
  * Based on this input perform analysis.
  * Analysis involve:
  *   - Word count
  *   - Character count on words
  *   - Character count on input
  *   - Split input into sentences
  *   - Separate each character
  *   - Find number pattern
  *   - Find email pattern
  * Results from analysis methods are used by other objects to display results.
